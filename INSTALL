This is the installation guide for the DataFax Toolkit

Prerequisites:
==============
You must have a working Python 2.7 installation. For Redhat/Centos you can use
the Redhat Software Collections Library (SCL). See

	https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/python27/

for more details on how to install this.

You'll need the following Python modules installed:

	pillow (https://python-pillow.org/)
	reportlab (http://www.reportlab.com/)
	pdfrw (https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw)
	xlsxwriter (http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)

These can be installed using:

	pip install pillow
	pip install reportlab
	pip install pdfrw
	pip install xlsxwriter

(Make sure you use the python 2.7 version of pip)

You'll also need a copy of 'gcc' and the rest of the software build tools.

Installation
============
Build the software by typing:

	make

This will create a dist directory with modules, PHRI and reports subdirectories.
Install the 'datafax' python module by typing:

	pip install dist/modules/datafax-1.0.2.tar.gz

Copy the contents of the dist/PHRI folder to /opt/datafax/PHRI and the contents
of dist/reports to /opt/datafax/reports
