This is the installation guide for the DataFax Toolkit

Prerequisites:
==============
You must have a working Python 2.7 installation. For Redhat/Centos you can use
the Redhat Software Collections Library (SCL). See

	https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/python27/

for more details on how to install this.

You'll need the following Python modules installed:

	pillow (https://python-pillow.org/)
	reportlab (http://www.reportlab.com/)
	pdfrw (https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw)
	xlsxwriter (http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)
	pyinstaller (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable)

These can be installed either system-wide or in a Python virtual environment
using :

	pip install pillow
	pip install reportlab
	pip install pdfrw
	pip install xlsxwriter
	pip install pyinstaller

(Make sure you use the python 2.7 version of pip)

You'll also need a copy of 'gcc' and the rest of the software build tools.

Installation
============
Build the software by typing:

	make

This will create a dist directory with modules, packages, bin and reports
subdirectories.

Copy the contents of dist into /opt/DFtoolkit

Copy the contents of dist/reports to /opt/datafax/reports


Binary Installation
===================
If you will be installing a pre-built distribution, perform the following
steps:

1) mkdir -p /opt/DFtoolkit
2) cd /opt/DFtoolkit
3) tar zxf DFtoolkit-X.X.X.tgz
	where X.X.X corresponds to the version number of the package.


Installing the DataFax Python Module
====================================
If you wish to develop your own tools, install the 'datafax' python module
by typing:

	pip install /opt/DFtoolkit/modules/datafax-X.X.X.tar.gz

where X.X.X corresponds to the version number of the package.
